# Forkify Project

This project is from Jonas Schmedtmann udemy course called `The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!`.

Forkify is a web application that allows users to search for recipes, update the number of servings, bookmark recipes, and create their own recipes.

## Features
The application offers the following features:

- Search for recipes using an API with pagination.
- Update the number of servings to automatically adjust ingredient quantities.
- Bookmark recipes for future reference. The bookmarks are stored in the browser's local storage.
- Create recipes that are automatically bookmarked and only visible to the user.

## Technologies used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
